I did some searching for an answer on the web and found mention elsewhere of the color distinction you mentioined. But, I can't see a difference in the color. I'm not saying there is no difference. I'm saying that, unless I saw a 3.0 port and a 2.0 port next to each other, I can't visually detect a difference in color.

However, I have noticed something else which I suspect may be the clue. The USB symbol imprinted next to the two ports on the left side of the computer is different from the standard USB symbol seen on all computers in recent years from the symbol next to the one port on the right side. The symbol on the left appears to include the old standard symbol but has what looks like "SS" below it. Can someone confirm that this symbol indicates the two ports on the left are the USB 3.0 ports?
 
I have an HP Pavilion dv7-6c95dx. It has two USB ports on the left side of the laptop and two USB ports on the right side. They are all black in color. But only the two on the left side have an SS designation next to the USB symbol, underneath the ports. I take it from your forum entry that these Super Speed (SS) ports are the USB-3 ports. (It still is taking a long time (6-8 hours) to back up the laptop even with these USB-3 connections. Admittedly, 318 GB is a lot to back up. I thought I may have been using the USB-2 ports.) The other two USB ports on the right side must be the USB-2 ports that come with this model. The HP on-line user manual did NOT identify which of these ports were the 2 or 3 type or offer the SS explanation.... Thanks much for your help.
 
Besides the initials "SS" net to the Superspeed USB 3.0 portals, the portals on my HP Envy tower are black in color (inside the portal) if they ARE NOT superspeed and blue in color if they ARE superspeed.
